Hello, my name is Ellen Coombs and I am a PhD student at the Natural History Museum and University College London  

Today I am talking about morphological evolution of the whale skull in a study that spans their evolutionary history. As you can see from the examples here, whales, dolphins, and porpoises show a lot of diversity across the clade from the earliest four-legged land dwellers to the behemoths we know today.

Before we get into the key methods and findings, let me give you a little context. 
Cetacea is nested within the artiodactyls – the even toed ungulates which includes cows and pigs  
50 million years ago, cetaceans looked like this – this is *Pakicetus*. They then rapidly began to adapt to an aquatic lifestyle – losing their hind limbs, whilst the nasals moved from the TIP of the snout to the TOP of the head

My dataset represents the archaeocetes, or ancient whales of 50 million years ago such as Pakicetus and the Basilosarids (note the forwards position of the nasals on the older species on the right and the more posteriorly placed nasals in the younger skull on the left).

39 million years ago, Cetacean split into two suborders. The mysticetes (or baleen whales) are represented by toothed specimens such as the Late Eocene *Mystacodon selenensis* (on the left) and Late Oligocene *Janjucetus hunderi* right through to the baleen whales we know today such as the blue whale. 
The specious odontocetes (or toothed whales) are represented from the Oligocene by species such as *Cotylocara macei* and other xenorophids on the right here and on the left, *Simocetus rayi*, all the way through to extant odontocetes such as the killer whale.

I started by looking at cranial morphology in cetaceans with the following hypotheses:  

1. The cetacean suborders will occupy distinct areas of the morphospace 
2. Bones related to breathing will differentiate the archaeocetes (which are the early whales) from the neocetes (which are the two living suborders of whales) 
3. Bones associated with breathing and unique feeding structures will show the fastest rates of evolution 

Once we have a better understanding of the morphology of the skull, I look at ecological influences on cranial morphology including diet, feeding method, dentition, echolocation ability, and habitat.  

I hypothesize that skull shape is largely driven by these factors associated with diet.  

Data for these ecological categories were taken from the literature and all details can be found on my Github link again accessed via this QR code  

A reminder of which of these two key hypotheses we are referring to is provided on the relevant slides throughout.

To help me answer these research questions, I travelled around the world collecting hundreds of 3D surface scans of whale skulls from both hemispheres, including this grey whale skull at the Smithsonian.  

In total for this study I scanned 199 species from 121 genera and 42 families.  

The really exciting thing about this dataset, is, not only is it the largest of its kind in the world, but it contains more fossil specimens than extant specimens, some of which are almost 50 million years old. We have also managed to sample around 95% of extant cetacean species.  

On the right-hand side, you can see a breakdown of scan numbers and ages for this dataset  


# SLIDE 5 
So, how did I collect the morphological data from these scans to quantify cranial morphology in cetaceans?  

Using software called Checkpoint, I manually placed 123 fixed landmarks and 124 curves on each of the skulls.  

In July we published a study on asymmetry in the whale skull, which informed my landmarking protocol for this current study. 

The mysticetes showed little asymmetry which meant I could landmark one half of the skull, and then use that bilateral symmetry to mirror those landmarks for the whole skull. 

We found asymmetry in the odontocete skull and archaeocete skull, so I devised a separate protocol of landmarking all the asymmetric bones, like the face and rostrum, and then mirroring the landmarks and curves from symmetrical bones only.  
 

# SLIDE 6  
I then did a Principal Component Analyses on data that had undergone Procrustes Superimposition – this means that the data are rotated, translated, and scaled so that we are only looking at shape.  

We see that the suborders occupy distinct areas of the morphospace  
The highest variation is seen in the length of the rostrum – from the brachycephalic, stubby faces of suction-feeding species like the Miocene *Odobenocetops* through to the dolichocephalic - long snouted fish-eating species including the fossil Eurhinodelphids and extant river dolphins. 

The second axis of variation is found in the positioning of the nares – from closer to the tip of the snout in the earlier whales, like *Pakicetus* and *Ambulocetus*, through to the positioning of the nares high on the head in extant cetaceans. Note how the odontocetes occupy a large range of the morphospace.


# SLIDE 7 
We also see overlap in the occupation of shape space between the archaeocetes and the early Oligocene odontocetes and mysticetes as the suborders begin to move towards subclade-specific diversification of the rostrum and facial morphology 


# SLIDE 8 
Now let’s look at rates of evolution in each of the bones of the skull for each of the suborders.  

For these next couple of slides, hotter colours indicate higher rates.  

The highest rates in the skull across archaeocetes, odontocetes and mysticetes are concentrated in the face (such as in the frontal and nasal) reflecting the extreme change in the positioning of the nares and retrograde telescoping as well as asymmetry in the odontocetes.  

The archaeocetes also show a high rate of evolution in the palate
The mysticetes show a high rate of evolution in the parietal – as the skull has become flattened and streamlined in modern baleen whales.  

Rates of evolution were lowest in the back and ventral back of the skull and results for disparity between the bones showed a similar pattern.  


# SLIDE 9 
I then looked at rates of evolution across the whole skull using BayesTraits, where a Brownian Motion model with variable rates had the best model fit.  

Don’t worry that you cannot see the species names in this phylogeny – it’s the same tree you saw earlier with additional archaeocete, mysticete, and odontocete examples represented by silhouettes.  

Firstly, we see a high rate of evolution as Cetacea diverges into the two suborders followed by fairly high rates of evolution in these newly diverging suborders. The Oligocene is a period of rapid evolution and high diversification in cetacean history, and also in the odontocete skull when echolocation and asymmetry were evolving. 

Further high rates in the odontocetes are seen in the mid and late Miocene, were we also found shifts in asymmetry in the skull in our earlier study 

The grey triangles seen throughout the phylogeny indicate the stem branches of clades with support for whole clade shifts in evolutionary rate. 


# SLIDE 10  
Now we’ve seen how morphology has changed over time, let’s take a look at our second research area and investigate what might have influenced those changes in skull shape. 

These images show some of the ecological variables I used, for example heterodonty, baleen, and several different feeding methods. 

Whales vary in size from the 1m long Vaquita to the 30m blue whale and unsurprisingly allometry (or shape related to size) is a significant aspect of skull shape variation. Because of this, I corrected for allometry and for phylogeny (that is the phylogenetic relatedness between species) throughout my analyses. 

We found that feeding method, diet, tooth type, echolocation ability and habitat all influenced skull shape. Habitat was more difficult to categorize, given some extant cetaceans migrate thousands of miles, or are conspicuous deep divers. 

I also ran these models using only extant data and got the same patterns of significance – please see my Github for details. 


# SLIDE 11 
This brings me to the conclusions for our first research questions 
that is, quantifying cranial morphology in cetaceans.

As hypothesized, cetacean suborders DO occupy distinct areas of the morphospace with some overlap between the later archeocetes, and the early Oligocene whales – after the suborders split.

Specifically, the bones associated with telescoping and the backwards movement of the nares differentiate the early whales from the neocetes. This is where we see high shape variation in the skull, alongside that movement
of the nares as well as the length and shape of the rostrum which is likely associated with diet type 

As hypothesized, bones associated with breathing and feeding, such as the nasals and maxilla show high rates of evolution across Cetacea. In addition, high rates of evolution are seen in the archaeocete palate, and in the mysticete parietal as the skull has flattened.

High rates of evolution and disparity in the skull are seen in the Late Oligocene – a period of rapid cetacean evolution and diversification and then again during the Mid-Late Miocene 
 

# SLIDE 12 
And then with ecological influences on cranial morphology 

I found that as well as the nares moving up the snout, and telescoping in the skull, the evolution of the whale skull is also largely driven by diet and related factors such as dentition and feeding method, as hypothesized. 

Habitat was also significant but as discussed it is hard to categorize so we interpret this with caution.  

And further, that echolocation ability also significantly influences skull shape with cetaceans that can echolocate having asymmetric nasal and facial 
Again, my previous work showed that there were shifts and jumps in cranial asymmetry in the Mid-Late Oligocene and Mid-Late Miocene.
 
 
# SLIDE 13  
This leads to the final chapter of my PhD where I will model cranial diversity alongside climate.  

My early analyses have shown that a model which tracks palaeotemperature has a better fit in explaining skull shape variation than Brownian motion and Early burst models  

And to finish, we’re seeing those peaks in disparity and rate in the Mid-Oligocene and Mid-Miocene and it will be important to see how this compares to temperatures of the time
