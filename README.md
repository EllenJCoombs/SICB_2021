Please see the 'Methods' folder for details on the methods used in my study

Please also be aware that a lot of my code is still under development for my PhD and is not shared here but I would be delighted to discuss methods - do get in touch! 

Ask me about specimens, collections I have visited, the trials and tribulations of landmarking asymmetric specimens!
