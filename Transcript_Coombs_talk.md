## SLIDE 1    

Hello, my name is Ellen Coombs and I am a PhD student at the Natural History Museum and University College London.    

Today I am talking about morphological evolution of the whale skull in a study that spans their evolutionary history. As you can see from the examples here, whales, dolphins, and porpoises show a lot of diversity across the clade from the earliest four-legged land dwellers to the behemoths we know today. 

## SLIDE 2  

Before we get into the key methods and findings, let me give you a little context.   

Cetacea is nested within the artiodactyls – the even toed ungulates which includes cows and pigs.    

50 million years ago, cetaceans looked like this – this is Pakicetus. They then rapidly began to adapt to an aquatic lifestyle – losing their hind limbs, whilst the nasals moved from the TIP of the snout to the TOP of the head. 

My skull dataset represents the archaeocetes, or ancient whales of 50 million years ago such as Pakicetus and the Basilosaurids (note the forwards position of the nasals on the older species on the right and the more posteriorly placed nasals in the younger skull on the left).   

39 milllion years ago, Cetacea split into two suborders. The mysticetes (or baleen whales) are represented by toothed specimens such as the Late Eocene Mystacodon selenensis (on the left) and Late Oligocene Janjucetus hunderi right through to the baleen whales we know today such as the blue whale. 

The specious odontocetes (or toothed whales) are represented from the Oligocene by species such as Cotylocara macei and other xenorophids on the right here and on the left, Simocetus rayi, all the way through to extant odontocetes such as the killer whale.    

  
## SLIDE 3  

I started by looking at cranial morphology in cetaceans with the following hypotheses:    

  1. The cetacean suborders will occupy distinct areas of the morphospace   

  2. Bones related to breathing will differentiate the archaeocetes (which are the early whales) from the neocetes (which are the two living suborders of whales)   

  3. Bones associated with breathing and unique feeding structures will show the fastest rates of evolution.   

Once we have a better understanding of the morphology of the skull, I look at influences on cranial morphology including ecological factors: diet, feeding method, dentition, echolocation ability, and habitat.    

I hypothesize that skull shape is largely driven by these factors associated with diet. 

And finally,   that evolutionary rates in the skull are driven by periods of climatic warming. 

Data for these ecological categories were taken from the literature. You can find a transcript and additional data on my Github using the QR code and link here.   


## SLIDE 4   

So, how did I collect the morphological data from scans to quantify cranial morphology in cetaceans?    

Using software called Checkpoint, I placed 123 fixed landmarks and 124 curves on each of the skulls.   

In July we published a study on asymmetry in the whale skull, which informed my landmarking protocol for this current study.   

The mysticetes showed little asymmetry which meant I could landmark one half of the skull, and then use that bilateral symmetry to mirror those landmarks for the whole skull.   

We found asymmetry in the odontocete skull and archaeocete skull  so I devised a separate protocol of landmarking all the asymmetric bones, like the face and rostrum, and then mirroring the landmarks and curves from symmetrical bones only.    


## SLIDE 5    

I then did a principal components analyses on data that had undergone Procrustes Superimposition – this means that the data are rotated, translated, and scaled so that we are only looking at shape.    

We see that the suborders occupy distinct areas of the morphospace    

The highest variation is seen in the length of the rostrum – from the brachycephalic, stubby faces of suction-feeding species like the Odobenocetops through to the dolichocephalic - long snouted fish-eating species including the fossil Eurhinodelphids and extant river dolphins.   

The second axis of variation is found in the positioning of the nares – from closer to the tip of the snout in the earlier whales, like pakicetus and ambulocetus, through to the positioning of the nares high on the head in extant cetaceans. Note how the odontocetes occupy a large range of the morphospace.   

## SLIDE 6   

Next, we looked at how the skull shape of different cetacean families varied from the mean, or average, cetacean skull shape. The hotter colours show a higher Procrustes distance, or greater variation from the average skull shape, shown here in black.  

There is a lot going on in this plot, so let’s take a look at some key observations for each suborder  . When compared to the average cetacean skull shape include, we can see the difference in the positioning of the nares in Archaeocetes, shown here in red.   

In the mysticestes, we also see this movement of the nares in the early diverging families such as the aetiocetids and mammalodontids. Later, we see the highest Procrustes distances in the rostrum, which appears to highlight the widening and flattening of the maxilla   

In the odontocetes, high Procrustes distances in extant families represent asymmetry in the face associated with echolocation – this is particularly high in the delphinids and monodontids. On the right hand side of the slide, in the Eurhinodelphids   and some extant river dolphins, you can see the highest Procrustes distances are in the rostrum, which is elongated in these families, but generally odontocete variation is seen in the nares and face.  

## SLIDE 7  

I then looked at rates of evolution across the whole skull using BayesTraits, where a Brownian Motion model with variable rates had the best model fit.   

Across Cetacea,   there are 3 key peaks in the rate of evolution in separate bones. These peaks are seen in the Late Eocene, the Mid-Late Oligocene   and the Mid-Miocene. Unsurprisingly, the nasal   shows high rates of evolution, particularly in the Mid-Late Eocene when the nares were moving from the tip of the snout to the top of the head and becoming more disparate between the two suborders.    

The Archaeocetes show a peak in maxilla, premaxilla, and nasal rates in the Mid-Eocene as the face was rapidly changing to adapt to an aquatic lifestyle. The flatline thereafter is due to there only being one archaeocete in the dataset (Kekenodon) which lived into the Late Oligocene    

The Mysticetes   show a peak in the evolutionary rates of several bones towards the end of the Eocene   after the two suborders had diverged with a further peak in the Late Oligocene  . Thereafter  , rates remain conservative  

The Odontocetes show several peaks in evolutionary rate in the Mid-Late Oligocene   and again in the Miocene  , possibly linked to increases in asymmetry associated with echolocation. Odontocetes seem to account for most of the signal seen for cetaceans as a whole.   

We also looked at rates for the whole skull across the phylogeny with some of the highest rates occurring at and just after the two suborders diverge    

The story for rates of evolution in the cetacean skull remains consistent with our previous work – key peaks occur in the Late Eocene, Mid-Late Oligocene, Mid Miocene.   


## SLIDE 8  

Now we have seen how cetacean cranial morphology has changed over time, let’s look at what might have influenced those changes.   

## SLIDE 9  

To investigate the influences of climate on cranial morphology we used climate data from Cramer et al., 2011 who use a benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope 18 record as a proxy for reconstructed trends in ice volume and deep ocean temperatures. We used this temperature data to run 22 models each with different evolutionary scenarios including BM, OU, an accelerated evolutionary trend, and an early burst model.  

A model with rate of cranial evolution tracking palaeotemperature (with rate of temperature changes vs. absolute temperatures) outperformed all models including Brownian motion and Early Burst and suggests highest evolutionary rates in the Latest Eocene and throughout the Oligocene (during periods of global cooling) with a further peak in rates during the Mid-Miocene warming period. 

For the final chapter of my PhD I will focus on climatic influences on cranial morphology in more detail, including running these models with full curve semilandmark dataset.   

## SLIDE 10  

Once we had looked at the effects of climate on cranial morphology, we investigated the influences of ecological variables. These images show some of the variables I looked at, for example dentition, such as heterodonty, baleen, and several different feeding methods. Most data were taken from Hocking et al., 2017.  

Whales vary greatly in size from the 1m long vaquita to the 30m long blue whale   and unsurprisingly allometry (or shape related to size) is a significant aspect of skull shape variation.   

Because of this, I corrected for allometry and for phylogeny (that is the phylogenetic relatedness between species) throughout my analyses    

We found that feeding method, diet, tooth type, echolocation ability, and habitat all influenced skull shape. I also ran these models using only extant data and got the same patterns of significance.  

## SLIDE 11   

This brings me to our conclusions…    

Firstly, quantifying cranial morphology in cetaceans;   

The cetacean suborders DO occupy distinct areas of the morphospace with some overlap between the later archaeocetes, and the early Oligocene whales – after the suborders split. 

Specifically, the bones associated with telescoping and the backwards movement of the nares differentiate the early whales from the neocetes.    

This is where we see high shape variation in the skull, alongside that movement of the nares as well as the length and shape of the rostrum which is likely associated with diet type. 

High evolutionary rates are seen in the Late Eocene and Mid-Late Oligocene in the mysticetes and odontocetes, and additionally   in the Mid-Late Miocene in the odontocetes. 

 
## SLIDE 12   

And finally looking at influences on cranial morphology..   

I found that as well as the nares moving up the snout, and telescoping in the skull, the evolution of the whale skull is also largely driven by diet and related factors such as dentition and feeding method.    

Habitat was also significant but as cetaceans are often wide-ranging or inconspicuous, this ecological variable is particularly hard to categorize and we interpret it with some caution.   

The best-fit climate model suggests highest rates in the Latest Eocene and Early-Mid Oligocene (during periods of global cooling) with a further peak in evolutionary rates during the Mid-Miocene warming period.  

The Late Eocene and Mid-Late Oligocene are known periods of rapid cetacean evolution and diversification, as picked up in our models.
